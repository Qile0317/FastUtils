* This is a resubmission of a new package `FastUtils` 0.1.0. The issues regarding documentation and package installation in examples have all been fixed. No packages are installed in any functions nor examples nor tests.

The note about non usage of the `lifecycle` package is a false positive - I use the badges function in the `roxygen2` documentation.
