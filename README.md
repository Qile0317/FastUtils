Github pull requests from forked branches are more than welcome as it is mostly a solo-project at the moment. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please also make sure to update tests as appropriate.

An explanation of the algorithms will eventually be made publicly available in a either a pre-print or developer vignette.
